## Learning PHP and Laravel

This repository contains the code and files I created during my learning journey with PHP and Laravel.

In order to align my skills with industry demands and personal goals, I have decided to discontinue my Laravel studies and focus on mastering the MERN stack for backend development, better preparing myself for future projects and opportunities. 🧑‍💻
